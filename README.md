# JobProcessing

This program pocesses jobs using a Sorted Priority Queue and Heap Priority Queue. All list classes and
interfaces are custom made from scratch. Positions are randomly set when jobs are created and each job 
has a job length that is randomly generated. When a job is processed the length is decreased and put back
into the queue into length is equal to zero and job is finished processing. 

The goal of this program is to test a Sorted and Heap Priority Queue against eachother. The program will
keep track of the time taken.
